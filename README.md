## Description:
Do you have problems with userbots that spam your groups or add your group members to other chats? 
Then this package can help you to protect your groups and members! 
It's very easy to integrate into your existing bot and also easy to customize the CAPTCHA image with your own fonts. <br />
You can also choose between digits and hexdigits for your CAPTCHA generation. <br />
*Note: You should have basic knowledge about the pyTelegramBotAPI* <br />

## Writing a CAPTCHA bot:
  
#### Import TeleBot and the CapchaManager:
```python
from telebot import TeleBot
from pyTelegramBotCAPTCHA import CaptchaManager
```
  
---
  
#### Initialize the bot and the captcha_manager:

Its required to pass the `user_id` of your `TeleBot` instance! You get it with `bot.get_me().id` <br />
You can add the following optional parameters:
  * `default_language` (str) the default language to use if not set in `captcha_manager.send_random_captcha(...)`. Currently supported "en", "ru" and "de"
  * `default_timeout` (float) the default timeout to use if not set in `captcha_manager.send_random_captcha(...)`
  * `fonts` (list) the fonts to use instead of the builtin ones (must be a list of .ttf file paths). You can user as many font as you like, but keep in mind that the all the fonts are loaded into your memory, so use a lot but not to many.
  
```python
bot = TeleBot("<bot-token>")
captcha_manager = CaptchaManager(bot.get_me().id)
``` 
 
---
  
#### Add a message handler for new chat members:

We need a message handler to restrict the new member and sending a CAPTCHA when a new user joins the group. <br />
`captcha_manager.restrict_chat_member()` requires your `TeleBot` instance, the `chat_id` and the `user_id`. <br />
`captcha_manager.send_random_captcha()` requires your `TeleBot` instance, the `Chat` object and the `User` object. <br />
You can add the following optional parameters:
  * `language` (str) the language to use for this CAPTCHA
  * `add_noise` (bool) add noise to the CAPTCHA image
  * `only_digits` (bool) only use ditgits instead of hexdigits for the CAPTCHA code
  * `timeout` (float) to set a timeout for the CAPTCHA in seconds.
  
```python
# Message handler for new chat members
@bot.message_handler(content_types=["new_chat_members"])
def new_member(message):
  #Â get the new chat member
  new_user_id = message.json.get("new_chat_member").get("id")
  new_user = bot.get_chat_member(message.chat.id, new_user_id).user

  # Restrict the new chat member
  captcha_manager.restrict_chat_member(bot, message.chat.id, new_user.id)

  # send random CAPTCHA
  captcha_manager.send_random_captcha(bot, message.chat, new_user, only_digits=True)
```

---

#### Add a callback query handler:

We need a callback query handler, to handle the users input when he pressed a CAPTCHA button. <br />
`captcha_manager.update_captcha()` requires your `TeleBot` instance and the `CallbackQuery` object as parameters. <br />
It automatically returns if `callback` was not from a CAPTCHA button or the wrong user pressed a button. <br />
If the wrong user pressed a button he gets an callback query answer denying his input.
If the submit button is pressed the CAPTCH is automatically checked and your corresponding [CAPTCHA handler function](#add-captcha-handler-functions) is called.
  
```python
# Callback query handler for CAPTCHA inputs
@bot.callback_query_handler(func=lambda callback:True)
def on_callback(callback):
  # update the CAPTCHA
  captcha_manager.update_captcha(bot, callback)
```
  
---
  
#### Add CAPTCHA handler functions:
  
This works just like you know it from message handlers from the pyTelegramBotAPI.<br />
A `Captcha` object will be passed to your functions. <br />
The `Captcha` object has the following attributes:
  * `message_id` (int) the message id of the CAPTCHA message
  * `user` (User) the user that must solve the CAPTCHA
  * `chat` (Chat) the chat
  * `users_code` (str) the code entered by the user
  * `correct_code` (str) the correct code to solve the CAPTCHA
  * `language` (str) the language of the CAPTCHA text
  * `created_at` (float) the timestemp when the CAPTCHA was created
  * `previous_tries` (int) the number of tries the user made
  * `incorrect_digits` (int) the number of digits that dont match
  * `solved` (bool) has the user solved the CAPTCHA? it does not matter if he solved it correct

Lets add our first captcha handler that handles correct solved CAPTCHAs.
  
```python
@captcha_manager.on_captcha_correct
def on_correct(captcha):
  bot.send_message(captcha.chat.id, "Congrats! You solved the CAPTCHA")
  # We unrestrict the chat member because he solved the CAPTCHA correct.
  bot.restrict_chat_member(captcha.chat.id, captcha.user.id, None,
    True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True)
  captcha_manager.delete_captcha(bot, captcha)
```

Lets add a handler that handles wrong solved CAPTCHAs. We give the user a second try if only one digit was wrong and the user only tried it once. <br />
We use the attributes `incorrect_digits` and `previous_tries`.
  
```python
@captcha_manager.on_captcha_not_correct
def on_not_correct(captcha):
  if (captcha.incorrect_digits == 1 and captcha.previous_tries < 2):
    captcha_manager.refresh_captcha(bot, captcha)
  else:
    # We ban the chat member because he failed solving the CAPTCHA.
    bot.kick_chat_member(captcha.chat.id, captcha.user.id)
    bot.send_message(captcha.chat.id, f"{captcha.user.first_name} failed solvinng the CAPTCHA and was banned!")
    captcha_manager.delete_captcha(bot, captcha)
```

Now lets add a handler that handles timed out CAPTCHAs
                                                                    
```python
@captcha_manager.on_captcha_timeout
def on_timeout(captcha):
  # We ban the chat member because he did not solve the CAPTCHA.
  bot.kick_chat_member(captcha.chat.id, captcha.user.id)
  bot.send_message(captcha.chat.id, f"{captcha.user.first_name} did not solve the CAPTCHA and was banned!")
  captcha_manager.delete_captcha(bot, captcha)
```

Thats it! <br />
For an working example, take a look at the `captcha_bot.py` file in the 'examples' folder.
